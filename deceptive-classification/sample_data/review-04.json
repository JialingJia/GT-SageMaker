        { "text": "This hotel is ok but is not the best for the money. First of all the parking prices are exorbitant. I know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high. Also, the service at this hotel was poor. I felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general, and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us. In addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet. Also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you. I would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House." },

        { "text": "I stayed at the Palmer House for @ $150/night on a corporate rate. The bed was excellent, the linens/towels were top of the line. I did not find my room shabby, as other reviewers noted. The Palmer House is over 130 years old. Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture; I think that lends to the ambience of the place. It is expensive, and I'm not sure I'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab. But the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring." },

        { "text": "The hotel is almost always very helpful. This stay caused me to re-think if I like the Palmer House. I had dirty covers for the bed. It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure. My husband and I usually come 8 times each year. He is there doing Business and CTA work. We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now. Rooms have always had two chairs, desk, and usually 22 by 25 feet. Not this room on the 11th floor. It was only 15 X 17 approx. The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time. In the past we had a bell man steal a $300. pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially." },
